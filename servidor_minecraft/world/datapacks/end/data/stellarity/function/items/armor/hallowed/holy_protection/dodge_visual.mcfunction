# All these were for the cross seen above players head
# It is only visible when you have particles set to 'All',
# as it causes like 200 particles to appear at once
# My laptop, which I made this on, did not really like that.
# I was able to make a toast on it (10/10 toast)

# Update - I'm here reading this over a year later. What the fuck XD.
# Update 2 - I think another half a year passed. 
#			 The fact I wrote all of that still 
#			 amazes me to say the least.
# Update 3 -  decided to remove the 200 particles
#			  that were there to make a yellow cross sign.
